# Risk Management Framework
## Nazzaro Community Center Relocation Project

## Risk Management Approach

### Risk Identification Methodology
- Stakeholder engagement sessions for community concern identification
- Historical data analysis from similar historic preservation projects
- Environmental impact assessments for regulatory risk identification
- Financial feasibility studies for budget and cost risk analysis
- Expert consultation for technical and construction risk assessment

### Risk Assessment Criteria
**Likelihood Scale**:
- **Low**: 0-25% probability of occurrence
- **Medium**: 25-75% probability of occurrence  
- **High**: 75-100% probability of occurrence

**Impact Scale**:
- **Low**: Minimal effect on cost, schedule, scope, or compliance
- **Medium**: Moderate impact requiring management intervention
- **High**: Significant threat to project success requiring immediate action

**Risk Priority Score**: Likelihood × Impact (Scale: 1-9)

## Comprehensive Risk Register

### Critical Risks (Score 8-9)

**R1: Budget Overruns from Historic Building Repairs**
- **Risk Score**: 9 (High Likelihood × High Impact)
- **Description**: Unforeseen structural issues in historic building requiring additional $$$
- **Mitigation**: Early detailed structural assessments, contingency fund allocation
- **Contingency**: Additional grant applications, non-critical budget reallocation
- **Status**: Active monitoring during structural evaluation phase

**R4: Supply Chain Disruptions**  
- **Risk Score**: 9 (High Likelihood × High Impact)
- **Description**: Material availability issues affecting construction timeline
- **Mitigation**: Multiple supplier relationships, advance material ordering for critical items
- **Contingency**: Material substitution plans, project phase adjustments
- **Status**: Continuous vendor relationship monitoring

**R11: Cost Inflation in Labor and Materials**
- **Risk Score**: 9 (High Likelihood × High Impact)  
- **Description**: Market price increases affecting budget projections
- **Mitigation**: Price-locking contracts with vendors, value engineering alternatives
- **Contingency**: Budget reallocation identification, alternative material sourcing
- **Status**: Monthly market rate monitoring

**R12: Historic Building Structural Weaknesses**
- **Risk Score**: 9 (High Likelihood × High Impact)
- **Description**: Structural integrity issues requiring substantial additional repairs
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive structural analysis, feasibility studies before commitment
- **Contingency**: Additional contingency funding allocation for unexpected repairs
- **Status**: Ongoing structural engineering evaluation

### High-Priority Risks (Score 6-7)

**R2: Regulatory Approval Delays**
- **Risk Score**: 6 (Medium Likelihood × High Impact)
- **Mitigation**: Early city official engagement, comprehensive documentation preparation
- **Contingency**: Legal consultation for expedited approval processes

**R3: Community Opposition**
- **Risk Score**: 6 (High Likelihood × Medium Impact)  
- **Mitigation**: Regular public meetings, feedback incorporation into design
- **Contingency**: Plan modifications based on feasible community demands

**R5: Environmental Impact Concerns**
- **Risk Score**: 6 (Medium Likelihood × High Impact)
- **Mitigation**: Early environmental impact assessments, compliance verification
- **Contingency**: Project scope adjustments for environmental compliance

**R6: Construction Safety Hazards**
- **Risk Score**: 6 (Medium Likelihood × High Impact)
- **Mitigation**: OSHA-compliant safety measures, regular training programs
- **Contingency**: Emergency response plans, comprehensive insurance coverage

**R10: Grant Funding Delays**
- **Risk Score**: 6 (Medium Likelihood × High Impact)
- **Mitigation**: Phased funding utilization plans, close grant process tracking
- **Contingency**: Bridge financing options for cash flow management

**R13: Poor Contractor Performance**
- **Risk Score**: 6 (Medium Likelihood × High Impact)
- **Mitigation**: Strict performance metrics, penalty clauses in contracts
- **Contingency**: Pre-approved backup contractors for critical work phases

### Risk Categories and Management Approach

**Financial Risks (6 total risks)**
- Focus: Budget protection, contingency planning, cost control measures
- Key Mitigation: Early cost estimation, multiple funding source development

**Regulatory & Compliance Risks (3 total risks)**  
- Focus: Early engagement with authorities, comprehensive compliance documentation
- Key Mitigation: Proactive legal consultation, thorough permit preparation

**Community & Stakeholder Risks (2 total risks)**
- Focus: Transparent communication, feedback integration, trust building
- Key Mitigation: Regular public engagement, responsive design modifications

**Construction & Technical Risks (3 total risks)**
- Focus: Quality control, vendor relationships, technical expertise
- Key Mitigation: Multiple supplier relationships, rigorous quality standards

**Safety & Environmental Risks (1 total risk)**
- Focus: Worker safety, environmental compliance, emergency preparedness
- Key Mitigation: Comprehensive safety protocols, environmental impact assessment

## Risk Monitoring & Review Process
**Risk Review Board**: Monthly assessment meetings with stakeholder updates
**Risk Register Updates**: Continuous maintenance throughout project lifecycle  
**Reporting Frequency**: Bi-weekly risk status in project progress reports
**Escalation Triggers**: Any risk score increase above 7 requires immediate stakeholder notification

## Risk Response Strategy Framework
**Avoidance**: Modify project plans to eliminate high-probability, high-impact risks
**Mitigation**: Implement preventive measures to reduce likelihood or impact
**Transfer**: Use insurance, contracts, or partnerships to shift risk responsibility  
**Acceptance**: Acknowledge unavoidable risks with robust contingency planning
