## Critical Path Analysis
1. **Regulatory Approval Process** (Weeks 2-4): Cannot proceed without permits
2. **Historic Preservation Assessment** (Weeks 3-5): Determines renovation scope and budget
3. **Community Stakeholder Approval** (Ongoing): Essential for project legitimacy
4. **Contractor Selection and Contracting** (Weeks 7-8): Critical for execution capability
5. **Structural Engineering Evaluation** (Weeks 5-7): Determines construction feasibility

## Key Milestones & Success Criteria

| Phase | Milestone | Success Criteria | Risk Dependencies |
|-------|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Project Charter Approval | All stakeholders aligned on scope and objectives | Stakeholder resistance (R3) |
| 2 | Permit Package Submission | Complete regulatory documentation submitted | Regulatory delays (R2) |
| 3 | Design Approval | All plans approved by regulatory authorities | Design flaws (R7) |
| 4 | Contract Execution | All major contracts signed and funding secured | Budget issues (R1, R11) |
| 5-6 | Construction Commencement | Site prepared and construction initiated | Safety risks (R6), contractor performance (R13) |
| 7-8 | **Leadership Phase Completion** | **Team coordination and risk mitigation successful** | **All active risks monitored** |
| 9-10 | Facility Completion | Construction finished and quality approved | Technical issues, budget overruns |
| 11-12 | Community Handover | Facility operational and community engaged | Community acceptance, final approvals |

## Timeline Risk Factors
**High-Impact Delays**:
- Permit approval processes (2-6 month potential delay)
- Historic preservation compliance requirements
- Community stakeholder approval processes
- Unexpected structural issues in existing building

**Mitigation Timeline Strategies**:
- Parallel processing of approvals where possible
- Early stakeholder engagement to prevent delays
- Contingency timeline planning for critical path activities
- Regular progress monitoring and adaptive scheduling
